# react-xwing-backend

To see the front-end client that uses this API, visit this repo: https://github.com/keaton-robinson/react-xwing-squad-builder.

Coming soon.
I'll be making a simple REST api powered by Node/Express. I plan to use MongoDB Atlas as my database. 

This should be a pretty simple api. I should mostly just need CRUD operations for user squads.

I intend to use google OAuth to begin with for authentication & authorization.
