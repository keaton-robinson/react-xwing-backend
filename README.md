# react-xwing-backend
A simple REST-ish api for saving and loading "squads" created in my xwing squad builder

To see the front-end client that uses this API, visit this repo: https://github.com/keaton-robinson/react-xwing-squad-builder

There's no "react" in this repo. It's only called "react-xwing-backend" because I named my frontend repo "react-xwing-squad-builder".
